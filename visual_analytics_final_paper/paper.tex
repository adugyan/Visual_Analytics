\abstract{The problem of missing data is both ubiquitous and pernicious. It affects nearly all multivariate data sets of substantial size and contributes to bias and uncertainty in visualizations and analysis alike. Unlike other sources of uncertainty, adding more data does not reduce uncertainty as the new data often contains more missing values. Many implementations of machine and statistical learning algorithms do not handle missing values well if at all, requiring simulation of missing values to complete the data through imputation. However, an incomplete understanding of the patterns of missingness in the data may lead to an incorrect approach to imputation, resulting in unreliable analyses and incorrect models.

Statistical assessments of missing values can only take the analyst so far, as many subtle but important structures in the missingness of data cannot be revealed or explained through purely statistical means. Visualizations of missing data are well-placed to aid the analyst in finding hidden structure and correlations to help explain how and why data is missing. In this paper we first examine the case for using visualizations and visual analytics tools to explore structures of missing data, how they can help the analyst gain important insights and why they are ultimately necessary to both effectively and efficiently diagnose, through both visualization and analysis, the underlying mechanisms that lead to missing values. We then address issues of designing intelligent visual analytics system to aid the analyst in diagnosing and understanding sources of missing data.}
